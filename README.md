Rotation Lock+Landscape Mode
============================

This my fork of Peng Huang's FOSS rotation locker for Android which adds Landscape mode. Unlike the original, it requires at least Android 3.0(API level 11). One click of the application locks you in Portrait mode, the second click locks you in Landscape mode. This application is also available from F-Droid.

F-Droid(Recommended source)
